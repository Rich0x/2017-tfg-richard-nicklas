#Computer Vision algorithm optimization on FPGA



Week 1:

  FPGA:
  
    FPGAs and Verilog HDL:
    
      From Intel FPGA youtube channel(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0wEPiFb0J6AZZ3oPXRoRpw): 
        -Verilog HDL Basics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJGvZSlsLKs):
          Brief overview of Verilog structure, terminology and syntax.
        -How to Begin a Simple FPGA Design(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwoyQ_RnaiA)
     
     
    Simmulation:
    
      -List of HDL simulators(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HDL_simulators)(including Open-Source):
      
          Commercial:
            --Alteras ModelSim: seems to be one of the best and most popular but isn't open-source. Yet it's available in student, or evaluation/demo edition.

          Free:
            --EDA Playground(https://www.edaplayground.com/): Online IDE

          Free & Open-source:
            Found two interesting solutions

            -- Icarus verilog (http://iverilog.icarus.com/): Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. 
                ·Nice Fandom wiki https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page
                ·Compatible with free waveform viewer (GTKWAVE)

            --Verilator(https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator): converts Verilog to a cycle-accurate behavioral model in C++/C/SystemC.
